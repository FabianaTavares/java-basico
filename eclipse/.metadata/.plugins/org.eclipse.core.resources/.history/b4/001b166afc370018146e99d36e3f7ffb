			/*
			 * The answer is 4.0 because
			 * When evaluating the arithmetic expression 2.0 * (5 / 2), Java will evaluate the expression
				inside the parentheses, 5 / 2. When dividing two integers, Java will take ignore the
				remainder, so 5 / 2 evaluates to the integer 2, not the double 2.5. This process is called
				truncation. The second step in evaluating the expression is evaluating 2.0 * 2. When
				multiplying a double and an integer, the result is a double, so the value printed is the double
				4.0.
